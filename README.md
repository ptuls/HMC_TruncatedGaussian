# HMC_TruncatedGaussian
Hamiltonian Markov Chain (HMC) code for generating multivariate truncated Gaussian random variables with general covariance matrix and 
linear inequality constraints. Current version is a Cython-based version. Pure Python version available in directory python/. Based on 
[Matlab code](https://github.com/aripakman/hmc-tmg) by Ari Pakman.
